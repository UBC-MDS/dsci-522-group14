## Wine Quality Prediction
* contributors: Cameron Harris, Jianru Deng, Yuyan Guo, Vignesh Lakshmi Rajakumar

Machine learning models used to predict wine quality based on various physical and chemical properties of wine. 

### About

A publicly available [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) containing physicochemical testing results of 4898 wines was used to predict wine quality as a score from 0-10. The goal of the project was to answer the following research question:

> Can we predict the quality rating of a wine based on its physicochemical properties alone?

- insert details about analysis plan here: e.g. data wrangling, feature selection/transformation, model selection, etc. 
- some other things we may want to mention: is our target balanced/unbalanced? are all features required to make prediction?
