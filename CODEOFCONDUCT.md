### Introduction

In the spirit of creating a safe, respectful work environment for the duration of DSCI 522, our team has drafted this Code of Conduct. All members of the team should conform to the Code of Conduct during any teamwork activities including, but not limited to, online meetings (e.g. Zoom, Slack), email communication, online forums (e.g. Github). 

Since we are all expected to conform to the overarching [MDS Code of Conduct](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/code_of_conduct/), matters that require escalation will default to the MDS Code instead of this one.

### DSCI 522-Group 14 Code of Conduct

While working together in DSCI 522, our team is dedicated to making the environment as welcoming and supportive as we can, for everyone on our team and that our team works with (e.g. TAs, Professors). At no point someone on the team should feel they are being harrassed, bullied, put down or attacked based on their background or identity. Any discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, religion or belief, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices and experience level will not be tolerated in any way.

### Expectations

Some key behaviours that our team will strive for to make this an inclusive and diverse space are:
- Using kind and inclusive language
- Respect differences in viewpoints and experience
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what's best for the community
- Be curteous and respectful
- Conflict is natural but handle it with maturity

### Unacceptable Behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour in our group include:
- Written or verbal comments which exclude individuals or groups of people
- Violent or abusive language directed towards another person
- Display of sexual or violent images
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Insults or put downs
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic or exclusionary jokes
- Excessive swearing

### Consequences of Unnacceptable Behaviour

If there is a breach of the Code of Conduct through behaviour that is deemed unacceptable, at the very least the person committing the breach will be warned and asked to issue an appology for their actions. If the breach continues or is of serious enough nature (as deemed by the collective team), the issue will be reported to the teaching staff for further investigation. 

If someone feels they are a victim of unacceptable behaviour or a breech of the Code of Conduct and it has not been caught by the team, it is in everyone's best interest to make this known so that it can be delt with appropriately. However, if you are not comfortable disclosing this to the team, then it is recommended to email Tiffany (DSCI 522 Professor) directly.
